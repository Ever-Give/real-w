Hello everyone,

I'm going to tell you what happened to me yesterday.

I wanted to go to the movie theater to see Alien Covenant which was released a week ago (I didn't like to go to the first sessions because I hate crowed theater), I was planning to go to midnight session because it's "an horror movie" but I check on internet that it was 2h00 long and since I have to take the tramway I just couldn't go to the last session and I prepared myself to go to 8pm. I had 1 hour to prepare myself (shower, make up) and 2 hours of free time with absolutely nothing to do, so I try to make time fly by listening to music on youtube (by the way I found this masterpiece : Jay C & Felix Baumgartner - Souk (Vertigo's Blissed-Out Sunset Mix)

) and wasting more time on videos but there was still more time to waste and I chose to go on omorashi.org to see if there was something new and then I remembered the topic about desperation challenge, which I tried to do a few times but always giving up before even being desperate need to piss... So it connected in my mind I was going to be a little bit more than 3hours outside, so if I drink enough before leaving I would be with a great need to pee by the time I come back to my house and then drinking a little bit more once at home and holding it for another couple of hours I would have great chances to be unable to control my bladder or at least giving up with a desperate feeling.

I drank 2 cappuccino, 1 glass of green tea with honey (better than putting sugar),1 glass of water and half a bottle of pineapple juice, the sum of that must be around 1,2 liters of liquid in my stomack, I prepared myself without forgetting to use the bathroom before leaving, The way to go to the cinema took normally 30min but I've been lucky and the tram went faster, in less than 25mins I was in the movie theater. And then the shock there was many many people! So I had to take the queue to buy the ticket, I saw that there was a new film that has just been released, king Arthur, I though that it was the explanation for all this people. I finally got the ticket the movie was going to begin in 10 mins I had time to take a coke and pop corn, but I was still full with all that I had take at home but I decided that since it's a 2 hours movie I could take the coke and the small cup of corns.

I arrived in the room just in time and hourra it was almost empty, but I still chose to go to my place that was a little more in the back that I wold like but it was in the center so no big problem. And then they began with their "propaganda" 15mins of adds no kidding, but I chose to take the situation by great side, if I spend more time here the more I will have to pee when I come back home. But, during the last minutes of adds, people began to flow in, I couldn't believe it's just as they were planning to come all at once just before the movie start... and of course half of them were teenagers that didn't understand that to enjoy a movie the best thing to do is just to stfu... Well anyway once the movie started their talks lower in volume so I could ignore them even if they were just to my left side. The movie began slowly almost boring in the beginning, and even my bladder didn't felt like it was receiving any liquid so I began to drunk the coke, and eat my pop corn.

Half an hour in the movie before story really begins, and it seems like my bladder was just synchronized because she began to distract me from the movie, some time later maybe half way through the film I began to feel my bladder fulling without being able to ignore it, I put my hand on my lower belly to feel if it was really that full or not, I put some pressure and... oh my God it was hard, not there was no bulge but I felt it stretch, and since I was wearing my black tight jeans I knew that my bladder will not have much space to expand, I watch what time it was 9:35pm. So I told to myself that I could wait till the end but 10 minutes after I felt like if my bladder tries to force my pee out, and I began trembling, the last time I began trembling this way I remembered was a time when I just had to change my pants...

9:55pm, fuck this I'm going to pee myself if I don't go now and don't know if I can make it to the bathroom without leaking, I wanted to go to the restroom but of course there was people everywhere, and I couldn't go without asking them to let me pass and I would be the one that disturbed the session (thing that I hate). So I had to try to calm down and hold it, I tried to keep my trembling to a minimum, but then I felt a small leak well I didn't felt it coming I just felt some warm liquid expending in my panties. I felt my crotch with my hand, still dry, But seconds later my bladder contract, I held my breath, my whole belly contract, I was feeling so uncomfortable I was still holding my breath but then I lost it...

A severe contraction made me bend forward breath out and pee, It was incredible in a sec my crotch thigh and bottom were bathed in my warm piss contrasting with the cold air conditioning, I somehow managed to stop it just to loose it a few seconds after, once the pressure fed out I was in panic, how was it possible that I lost it in less than 3 hours while I hold it for ages and having drunk more than I had, how was I going to come out without anybody noticing? how was I going to go back home unnoticed? How could I have been so stupid to not go when I felt I had to?! Why this movie couldn't end at time ? (it was 10:03pm)

Here I was, sat in my warm sit that absorbed all my piss, surrounded by people, sweating from the hold, beginning to notice the smell of my pee mixed with corn odor in the air. I was so ashamed, and scared, I would have cried if it wouldn't have attract attention to me. The movie was going to end soon, it was the last fight with the xenomorph, I had to think about how to go out unnoticed, I could spill my coke on my lap but no it was impossible that people believe it, my ass was drenched. So I had to wait for everyone to leave...

Of course some people also wanted to wait and see if there was another scene at the end but all persons on my left where gone, on my right there was only one girl and she was far away but in diagonal there was a couple that could see me or my wet seat if I stand now, I had to wait, but once I saw they were looking their cell phone I just rushed outside, I swear that as the door was closing behind me I heard a girl saying look she's pissed herself, I was humiliated, I kept walking as fast as my shoes let me, go down the stairs finally I was outside; the fresh air of the night cooling down the sticky wet stain on my butt and down my thighs.

I walked my eyes fixed on the ground, when I arrived at the tramway stop I put myself against the wall waiting for it to come. When I was sure no one was looking I looked down at my legs, I could see the dark stain but I was relieved that it could be mistaken for a shadow, I put my hands on my butt and to my horror I felt that my T-shirt got wet, I discreetly looked to it and it really showed that it was wet, a darkest shade of pink on the bottom covering my ass. there was nothing I could do my jacket was to short to cover this disaster, I wait 15min for the damn tram to arrive, with the wind blowing making me aware of the wetness that had traveled down my legs to the top of my calf. Once in the tram I put myself against the side and looked down in shame. I could smell my pee, even with all things that I drank it still smelled like pee, I'm sure the lady next to me noticed but said nothing to not humiliated me even more.

Once at my stop, I continued the walk of shame, I chose an indirect way to my house, longer but I know nobody go this way, my bladder must have been tired because I felt like if I was going to piss my pants a second time, the urge grew quickly, I knew I was going to lose it before arriving and I thought about just stand here and let it happen, but a "spark of pride" commanded me to at least find somewhere sheltered and to not do it in my panties which were drenched enough! I made a few steps, find my way behind a statue and lost it, no time to even try to pull down my jeans, I just squatted, peeing myself for the second time in less than an hour...

While I was wetting I could here it splattering below me, warming me a little bit; then I heard footsteps coming in my direction I cut the flow the best I could while I stood so I would not make any noise. And I wait a few moments for the man to go away, I still had to pee but I was now to nervous to let go again so I continue on my way to home. While I walked the need to pee turn into an urge again, and I just decided to let it go while walking, at first it wasn't coming but then I felt rivulets of pee going down my legs soaking my feet all that with every step I made, when my bladder was finally empty I didn't care, did not even felt relieved, just shameful, humiliated, and guilty.

Once I finally reached home I locked the door, fell on the floor and started crying, wanting to erase this day from my life, from my memory, I hate the now cold wet feeling on my legs but I wanted to punish myself for being so stupid, and I didn't change, I just ate some chocolate, put towels on my bed and fell asleep quickly.

Today when I woke up I stink of dried pee, at first I thought I also had wet the bed but fortunately I kept my bladder under control while I was sleeping, I just took a shower feeling still a bit ashamed an also a bit turned on when I saw the yellow stain on my white panties half way up in the front and all the way in the back and the dark bow-shaped stain that remained on my T-shirt.

Thank you for your support^^

I know that it was «just» an accident but what made it bad for me was that I was trapped in the room with no possibility to leave when I wanted with a fear that someone would see what I’ve done, I felt really vulnerable. I think that in other circumstances I wouldn’t have felt this way and could have enjoy the betrayal of my bladder.

Well now I'm feeling guilty about the person that had to clean up my seat , hoping that no one sat on it first... but it wasn't my fault (maybe a little bit...) I really tried to hold it in.

Well from front it wasn't to much noticeable but the sits on the cinema were red/orange and it turned darker, plus from behind we could see that the upper part of my legs was a different shade of dark than the rest of my pants and my T-shirt was the most screaming evidence...

When I stood up I didn't though of spilling my drink on the seat (well I also had the idea but it would have been weird that the sit got wet but not the front part of my legs.)

Well the movie wasn't that scary so I can't use this as attenuating circumstance

I mainly wrote it to describe what an unwanted accident can be like and how you feel when you could have avoid it, so people who want to try it in public know. (At least if I ever plan on doing an hold in public again I will not risk to do it if I can't leave; and I would not do it in one of the most crowded part of the city)

And also because I didn't felt well after this and wanted to be sure that from an external view it wasn't seen as if I done a too bad action; and well I knew that some of you would enjoy my "little mishap" and of course I have no problem with that^^
