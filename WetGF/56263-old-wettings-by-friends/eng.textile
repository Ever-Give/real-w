Ok so an old story (remember my stories are as true as I can remember memory is hazy after so many years).......I met a couple of girls at a party that I was at and we chatted, they were together as a couple and loved horses.....in fact they both rode several times every week, no matter what the weather..(I truly needed my 'stockmans coat' when I knew them and spent a lot of time with them). Now some may remember this story, I,m sure I told it a long time ago......???...The story is really about how the two girls met when they were teens.

Both were from the kind of family that could afford to indulge it's daughter with a horse and stabling costs..more of that later...but first I will describe the girls...one was so cute and petite, slim with no breasts to talk of , thin blond hair,but she was not so skinny that she had no shape at all... looked good in her riding gear, the other girl was, well amazonian.....she was a head taller than the other girl, dark brunette, big tits which she had when she was young, (first in her class at school so she said.) please don't get the idea that she was 'fat' in any way, it was all toned and muscle...both were joggers when not riding.....and had a gym room in the house for when the weather was too bad for anything else...

So we are getting the idea they were not paupers, both had gone to private schools, then university, the taller girl (I,m not going to say their names or make up names it seems silly) Had gone into Law as a profession and the slim girl was a chartered accountant... The tall girl drove a Saab Turbo convertible and the slim girl an Audi convertible.....they lived in a very nice house at the edge of a very nice town at the edge of the Cotswolds in UK, the house belonged to a relative and was their to use, it had been bought as an investment and all they had to do was live in it and pay their way, no rent to pay so they had extra money to indulge themselves...they didn't need Caribbean holidays and the like....they just loved to ride horse and each other...

Where the hell did I, a straight male come in? They said they just liked me and had never met a guy before that they would let into their lives, they also wanted a baby. Now there was one problem (small really) the slim girl only did accountancy part time, her main job was training young riders at a riding school and she had taken a big hit with money for that love. Things might be tight with a baby, because it was a the tall girl who really wanted to be the birthmother. I just realised that I have told enough about them and nothing about how they met. So they were both still at school when they met, one was 13 and the other 15......

The slim girl was a new girl in town and they met at the stables, where the slim girl and her parents had gone to check out the facilities for keeping her horse.....Tall girl came riding in from a hack and their eyes met and it was love at first sight, or rather slim girl saw that tall girl had a huge wet patch on her jodhpurs.....Tall girl was very casual about it and chatted to slim girl and her parents about the stables etc and both girls became friends...went riding together a lot......(I,m going to simplify the next bit)...

They found out that they both had a love of wetting in the saddle of which their parents despaired....but tolerated....they didn't wet the bed or in public elsewhere, just in the saddle and they later in a romantic episode were sheltering together from a strong rainstorm when they kissed and became lovers, (not going to mention ages...work it out for yourself)

Oh and it was the younger slim girl who instigated the kissing and more.......they went on together through University one ahead but doing a longer degree and when finished they looked for work in the same town and were lucky enough as I said earlier to have a place to live for free.....thus began their happy times.....So they after several months of knowing me and sharing wine and even a bed with me....they were not totally anti men, just so into each other they didn't notice men.....

We had fun...went places as a threesome and did things together until they trusted me enough to tell me of their plan....baby plan...So without further ado we set to, without any jealousy, we all took part, in making the tall girl pregnant...... But after many months..nothing happened and it should have....so she went to a doctor and found that she couldn't......So we drank wine and cried together ...then came an abortive attempt to make a baby, with me and the slim girl, her heart was not in it, she didn't want to have a baby like the other girl did.....So after just one real try we didn't try anymore......and realised it was not going to happen.

Then my work moved me.......I had been in guy heaven for almost a couple of years.....two girls who liked me and would wet their panties for me (not in public - they only did jodphurs in public).....but would wet in the house if I asked...even in the bed....(I,m not into golden showers - they liked to pee on each others pussy, but not all over the place....the bed in that house cost as much as my car!!!!! Are they still together? yes, do I keep in touch, not enough...my life has moved on.....Did they adopt a child as rules changed..

No...they got over that phase of their relationship...they still pee while riding....and don't give a damn who sees their wet jodphurs......during one of the last chats I had on skype with the slim one who still teaches riding.......she told me that even she is amazed at how many young girls will pee their pants and jodphurs rather than get off the horse and go to the toilet. !!! It's a Horsey thing. Life has moved on a bit from the 80's 90's and maybe there are no 'Riders' here?? who can relate to this story. Remember it is all true, but some details are vague now so I couldn't do dates and times....Saab Turbo dates it a bit..??? I forgot a funny bit...I once said that they looked so funny in bed with the petite slim girl climbing on top of the tall Amazon...they pretended to be angry for a little while about that quip.

Have you posted the whole story?

}}

I think I just about covered everything.....I hope I didn't leave people thinking there was more? If I did it was unintentional, I did simplify boring bits.....or what I thought was boring...One of them did go to Cheltenham Ladies College.....that won't mean much to many people. If you have any questions do ask and I will try to remember more about specifics....what I will not do is make it up to satisfy someone's desires...it will be what I remember and no more.
