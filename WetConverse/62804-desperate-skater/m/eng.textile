During the morning I drank lots of water to stay well hydrated. Around 13:00 I diced to take a long ride on my longboard. I grapped my beanie since it was not that warm outside anymore and put on my old trashed converse. They have holes and you can see my toes/socked on multiple places but I still love to wear them. My bladder was already pretty filled from all the water but I don't wanted to waste more time so I ignored it.

After an 30min ride I stopped at an coffe shop and ordered an Cappuccino and a glass of water. Once I drank both I continued my ride. Suddenly I had to pee really bad. I was ~45min away from home and no way to go to the toilet. I decided it was time to go home now and turned around and begun my ride home. After half an hour another huge pee wave hit my bladder and a stream of piss escaped into my boxershorts and jeans. I managed to stop it pretty fast so no damage was done

When I reached home I was hardly able to hold it back. Just had enough time to put down my phone an take some pics for you. Jumped back on my board and just relaxed. The feeling of relief was just great. The pee gushed out into my boxershorts, running down my jeans filling up my chucks. It was so much it even splashed down on my board :P. I completely emptied my bladder right there. Everything got soaked
