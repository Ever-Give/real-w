Around 10am me and my mum were leaving the house to go into town, it’s around a 20 minute drive so I though ‘I’ll just hold it until I get there, no problem’ hahaha well that was about to change.

We parked up in a fairly empty car park and got out, went around some shops and as we’re going out the supermarket my mum saw one of her friends and started chatting to her, for 45 minutes! I’m quite desperate at this moment in time so her friend points to me and asks,

”is she ok?” As she’s sat wriggling and squirming a bit, she looked as if she was about to burst.

My mum just gingerly replied with,

”yeh she just needs to pee, it won’t be long before she wets her pants haha”

Her friend replied with, “same here it’s not long before I’ll have soggy leggings on haha”

I'm just stood holding my crotch, squirming around holding my pee trying to not make it obvious to her friends that I’m absolutely bursting for a wee and then she just blurts it out.

45 mins go by and my mum forgot that she had a dr’s appointment at 11:30 so her friend offered to take me back home, which was very nice of her. I jumped into her car and waited for her still squirming and holding my crotch.

Her friend comes over and gets in the car and begins to drive off and then she says,

”I don’t mind if you pee your pants, I’ll pretend I didn’t see it” and then winked at me, I just replied,

”won’t it stain your seats?” She looked at me and said, “you see that big stain that’s already on it? That’s from your mum when she has an accident last week and the seat I’m sat on has the same stain from me so don’t worry”

I just nodded and then a few seconds passed and the sound of her piss hissing out and soaking her pants echoed throughout the car, I couldn’t control myself and pee started to gush out into my leggings leaving a big wet stain on the seats and on both of our bums, she dropped me off at the end of the lane to my house and I walked up to the house in soggy leggings, and a very ache bladder...
