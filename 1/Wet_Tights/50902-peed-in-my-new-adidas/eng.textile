Got some new Adidas Superstars that I've worn a few times to work now. But today when I got home, I just couldn't resist in letting go a little in them. They've soon dried again, and don't smell, so I can wear them soon again when going out.

Wonderful pictures, I like the lighting as it really brings out the wet patch

Yeah, I'm glad you can see something. But wetting invisibly is good too, when out in public...😇

Not sure those shoes quite dried. But otherwise almost - until I let go a little again.💦😉

Marketing Adidas? Lol😊. I'm sure they're up for this.

Btw, after that I let go a little more, my legs got rather wet. More drips in the sneakers...

Some hours. They dried, mostly.

Or did you go out in public after they dried? What I love about going out once they've dried is that it starts to smell more and more as it dries (and even if you're well hydrated and the pee is completely clear, there will always be a stench), but you have no idea bc your nose grows accustomed at the same time.

Didn't go out this time, but yes it can smell a bit at times. If I do go out I normally change the top, which often seems to get wet at the bottom too. A fresh one helps. Also the shoes. But keep the rest on, it's a good secret to still be slightly wet between the legs. 😇
