I decided to be nostalgic today and re-download some old Warpmymind files. The one I listened to today was EMG's "Instant Wetting," a file that sets a trigger to the phrase "Urinate Now." Let's just say I'm glad I convinced @MadamPogo to let me have a doggy pad.

What the file did was build the idea of a full bladder, made me focus on it more. She said she saw me trickle out and had to help adjust the pad. and that's when I came out of trance. I thought I only tinkled a little, nope!

We got to use the trigger word while I wore a diaper at the mall

Is this a permanent thing?? I mean I don’t see a bunch of people using that phrase around me but I don’t want anything to be permanent

Try listening to induction files separately, that way you can find an induction that works the best for your trance

A mix of hypnosis and diaper play the past couple weeks may have made me a little urge- incontinent
