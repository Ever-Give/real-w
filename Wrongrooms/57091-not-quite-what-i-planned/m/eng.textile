Not quite what I planned

Been doing so holds recently so my bladder muscles are not very strong but wanted to go to the supermarket today. It’s cold here (about minus 2 Celsius). I chose to drink several cups of coffee, some OJ and a couple of glasses of water. I waited about half and hour and choosing not to be diapered I set out. I probably wasn’t wrapped up enough because I started shivering as soon as I left the house. I don’t know about you but I find it hard to hold when I’m cold.

Immediately my need shot to 7.5/10

I wondered about going back but pressed on.

It’s about 30 minutes to the store and half way there I leaked a little

Clenching down I carried on but it was getting worse.

Never mind I thought I’d use the washrooms in the store

But I never got there 10 minutes later a wave of desperation flooded over me and what I though might be a small leak felt more like Niagara Falls

Fuck clenching hard I managed to stop it but the damage was done

Nowhere to pee I decided to go home

About 2 steps from the door my bladder decided it had had enough - I shivered the flood gates opened and I gushed urine soaking my jeans and the doorstep

I was wet but it was fun
