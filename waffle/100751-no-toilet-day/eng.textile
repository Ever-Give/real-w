I'm sick today and one side effect apparently is that I need to pee like every 20 minutes.

I don't just wanna sit on the toilet all day, but wearin soaking wet clothing isn't gonna help my condition either. So I'm taking suggestions on what to do.

Ohh i think it's just a fever. Nothing that huge.

Well, you know with fever a very good thing is staying well hydrated

I don't really know about that I've drank two cups of water and one cup of coffee, still I've had to go multiple times today already.

How much ago did you go last time?

}}

Not much really, it's not like I have anything to relase it's just that I need to release, if that makes sense

{{1 minute ago, Doctor Pivetta said:

Yeah I think I can get that

Aas you said before you need to go like every 20 mins, wanna try make it at least 30/40 ?

}}

I guess I could try. But like I said I don't really think it's smart to be walking too much around my appartment in wet clothes. So wetting is kinda not an option

Maybe I could try going pee now and then trying to hold it to 40 minutes.

Actually I got a better idea

If I wore a skirt I woudln't have to get as many clothes wet and I could just pee whenever I needed with no soaked clothes and no cleanup

Thats smart, I think I will go pee and then see when I need to pee again

Okay just emptied, I also drank about two cups of water well see how long it takes meet to need to pee again

Nice

I would say you're not allowed to let go at least until your first few leaks, but of course if that's making you too sick just say it and we stop, do you agree?

Okay we can try that.

Cool, so you're in a skirt now?

}}

Yes I'm wearing a skirt now.

It's just black but I like that the fabric feels soft. And it's machine washable.

Okay so my estimate was right lol, 20 min and I already need to pee again 🤣

I'm trying to hold untill the first leak or so

I think i could just fold a towel under where I'm sitting and wait. Or I could go stand in the shower

Like I need to pee lol
