Are there any women out there, that upon going pee, ended up needing to go again very shortly after (within 20-30 minutes or even sooner), to where they got desperate to where they either could barely hold it or actually ended up peeing themselves in some way?

Also if any guys have out there have ever experienced this in person where a spouse, partner, or female friend needed to pee then had to pee again within 20-30 min, with being at the point of either extremely desperate or actually peeing themselves in any way this quickly after already using the bathroom, please share any stories or situations you may have.

If I've held my bladder for longer than normal then yes. My bladder gets full fast, and it's way way harder to hold it the 2nd time around.

Have you ever gotten to the point where you couldn't hold it all or accidentally ended up fully losing control this second time around, and also if so, how quickly after first going did it happen and/or how long were you able to to hold it after you first felt it come on?

I have a weak bladder so this happens quite often. But it happens more often depending on how much I drank and what I drank. Alcohol usually causes me to pee very frequently

Have you ever not been able to hold it?

Yes, I've definitely had an accident from the 2nd round of desperation lol! One of the times that sticks in my mind, I was out drinking with friends, and had held on for a long time before breaking the seal. Buuuut, as you guys all know, once you do that... it's soooooo much harder to hold. It probably was only about 30 minutes from using the toilet, to a leg crossing dance 🤭. I peed my pants about 10 or 12 minutes later so, I definitely can get desperate again quickly if I'm drinking, and a few times it's led to an accident 🤭🤷‍♀️😀

Did you keep doing the pee pee dance up until and while peeing your pants or did you end up crouching down to the ground to try to hold it and/or once you started peeing?

One ex of mine, she wasn't really into omo as much as she was just not into using public restrooms. She would go to ladies nights with her friends after work and because women drink free until a certain time, she would pretty much drink like a fish. On these nights she'll catch an Uber or Lyft home and wouldn't pee until she got here, so it's only fitting that not even 20 minutes later she'll be bursting and dancing around the bed trying to hold until she'll run to the toilet with more frequency throughout the night. Also made for some really good "adult time" 😉

Why does she dance around the bed first? Does she wake up where she can't hold it immediately upon getting out of bed?
