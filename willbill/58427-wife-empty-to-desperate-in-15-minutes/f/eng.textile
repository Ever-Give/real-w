Just figured to share an experience from a few weeks ago when my wife and I were coming home from having a couple drinks at a mutual friend's house. About 5 minutes into what was about a 20 minute drive home, my wife mentioned she needed to pee really bad as we were passing a gas station, so I obliged and stopped. As she went to the bathroom, I filled up the gas tank a tad. As she came out, I asked if she was wet and disappointing to me at the time, she said no.

As we left the gas station, it was about another 15 minutes till home, then a mere 5 minutes into the drive, she announced she had to pee again. Another 5 minutes passed and she was starting to squirm, cross her legs, and bounce up and down, saying how bad it was getting. This continued and got even worse the last 5 minutes of the drive, with her cursing at every red light that stopped us.

When we got home, she darted to the bathroom (as I followed) and sat down and immediately released a flood. I took the opportunity to look at and feel her panties, which they were completely soaked on the bottom.

This all happened in a mere 15 minutes after stopping to pee at the gas station, getting completely desperate to the point of losing control in this short of time.
