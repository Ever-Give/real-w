Did anyone first get into this based on experiencing a spouse, partner, or close friend desperate or peeing themselves?

Basically, for anyone that may not have originally seen or realized this as being a turn on, though became attracted to it (mainly as an adult) upon having seen or experienced a spouse, partner, or a close friend either:

- extremely desperate to pee in a certain situation

- accidentally and genuinely pee themselves

- just simply from watching them pee, no matter if they were desperate or just a normal occurrence

- having a small bladder, seeing them desperate frequently, or needing to pee urgently a lot where it caused you to start becoming attracted to it

If so, who was it, and if it was one specific experience that started it, what ended up happening where you first realized this was a turn on? Or if it was something gradual you became attracted to over time, was there a certain thing that caused you to start noticing or realizing it?

I wouldn’t say thats what officially started it but it did help. What I think started it was

1. my strange fascination with bathroom related stuff since i was in kindergarten

2. i had lots and I mean lots of accidents growing up even into high school

What was it that helped as you mentioned? Experiencing a significant other being desperate / having an accident or a significant other becoming fascinated from witnessing you desperate / peeing yourself?
