Not sure if this has been asked before, but have any women here ever experienced a sudden wave of desperation out of nowhere where you didn't end up making it to the bathroom in time?

Or, has anyone witnessed this scenario happen to a female friend or significant other? If so, what happened and what was the result?

That happens to me a bit more often than I'd like it to. It especially happens when I get home from somewhere.

When it happens as you get home from somewhere, do you ever end up having a full accident on the way to the bathroom or just end up having to do a mad dash to there right away?
