She cannot hold it at all, it's game over no matter what she is doing to try to hold it. If standing up and she needs to pee, even a slight press on her bladder will cause her to cross her legs instantly, to which she is able to hold it for only a few seconds before it starts trickling out, where she can't stop it. If laying down it comes out almost instantly, starting with a little trickle flowing up and out of her pussy as she tries to hold it, but it soon gives way into spraying out until fully empty.

Have you ever made her go in her pants that way? How does she feel about it?

Yes, most recently one time a few months ago when she had to go really bad, where our only bathroom was locked and in use at the time (a different instance than the one I wrote about earlier)....

She called me in the bedroom, where upon waking in, she had her legs crossed while bouncing up and down, saying she had to pee all of a sudden couldn't hold it almost at all. I knew she was about to completely piss herself so figured I'd just cut to the chase and play around a tad. Pressed very slightly on her bladder, as she stood with her legs still crossed, it started coming out almost immediately, with a visible stream shooting upwards and arcing outwards straight through her leggings. As she said she couldn't stop it, my hands were already down her pants, as she uncrossed her legs so I could feel it all coming out, where anytime my hand is down there as it starts coming out, she orgams hard and instantly because of how good she says it feels and knowing I really like it anytime she can't hold it
