Hello! a quick story about a sneezing fit wet accident happened to me yesterday:

I had to pee 7/10 but nothing too urgent, I was talking with Andrea on the phone about random stuff....

A little digression: even if We talk about pee and wet stuff since almost 5 years, I always had something that I was not able to tell him, and the big "secret" was that I've always had stress incontinence especially with coughing/sneezing/lifting up heavy weights, and also had giggle incontinence since I was a kid; idk why I was afraid to tell him, but some weeks ago I told everything and this was a big relief, now I feel better and free, it's beautiful to share EVERYTHING and to not have secrets

Returning to the main topic, I felt a sneeze coming and put an hand between legs to hold it, but surprise! it wasn't a single sneeze, it was a row of 6 sneezes!

After the second sneeze pee started to gusghing out loudly with every sneeze (and I was running to the bathroom). luckily I was wearing a pad and I soaked it as you can imagine, i also wet my panties and pajamas pants but I was laughing (like Andrea was), so I changed myself but I sent a video of the condition of my pad and now I want to share with you!

I hope you enjoy my story
